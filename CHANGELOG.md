# CHANGELOG

## 1.1beta – [no release date yet]

(Among many bugfixes...)

### I/O

- More permisive resuming.

### Parameterization and priors

- Made possible to fix a parameter whose only role is being an argument of a dynamically defined one.
- Likelihoods can be used in dynamical derived parameters as `chi2__[name]` (cosmological application: added automatic consolidated CMB and BAO likelihoods).

### Samplers

#### General

- Seeded runs for `evaluate`, `mcmc` and `polychord`.

#### MCMC

- Small improvements to callback functions.

#### PolyChord

- Updated to PolyChord 1.15 and using the [official GitHub repo](https://github.com/PolyChord/PolyChordLite).
- Fixed output: now -logposterior is actually that (was chi squared of posterior).
- Interfaced callback functions.

### Likelihoods

#### Created `gaussian_mixture` and added deprecation notice to `gaussian`

### Cosmological theory codes

#### General

- Added P(k) interpolator as an observable (was already available for CAMB, but not documented)

#### classy

- Updated to 2.7.1
- Added P(k) interpolator

### Cosmological likelihoods

#### DES

- Added Y1 release likelihoods [(arXiv:1708.01530)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.01530)

#### BICEP-Keck

- Updated to 2015 data [(arXiv:1810.05216)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05216) and renamed to `bicep_keck_2015`.
